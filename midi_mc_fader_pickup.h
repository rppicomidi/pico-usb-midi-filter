/**
 * @file midi_mc_fader_pickup.h
 * 
 * This file contains functions and data that implement fader "pickup" synchronization
 * between a DAW that expects to be connected to a Mackie Control control surface that
 * has motorized faders and a Mackie Control compatible control surface that has
 * non-motorized faders. The Mackie control fader move message is the MIDI pitch
 * bend message; pitch bend MIDI channels 1-8 correspond to fader channels 1-8;
 * pitch bend MIDI channel 9 corresponds to the main fader. Each fader value is a 14-bit
 * unsigned value encoded in the pitch bend position, 7 bit data, LSB first.
 * 
 * The DAW will send the current expected fader values to the control surface on
 * startup, fader bank change, mode change, etc. The faders on a control surface with
 * motorized faders will move to match the target fader values from the DAW. Non-motorized
 * faders cannot move to match target values all by themselves. This code provides data structures
 * that allow higher level code to filter out fader move messages to the DAW for an individual fader
 * until the user moves the fader up to or past the last target fader value the DAW sent for that fader.
 *
 * To use this code:
 * 1. Create as many mc_fader_pickup_t structures as you have hardware faders on your control surface
 * 2. Call mc_fader_pickup_init() to initialize each structure
 * 3. For each Mackie Control fader move message (MIDI pitch bend) you receive, extract the fader value
 *    by calling mc_fader_extract_value().
 * 4a. If the fader move message was from the DAW, update the structure by calling mc_fader_pickup_set_daw_fader_value().
 * Do not send the message to the control surface (it can't do anything with it anyway)
 * 4b. If the fader move message was from the hardware control surface, update the structure by calling
 * mc_fader_pickup_set_hw_fader_value() and note the return value. If the return value value was true, send
 * the fader move message to the DAW because the fader is in sync with the value the DAW thinks it should have.
 * Otherwise, do not send the fader move message to the DAW.
